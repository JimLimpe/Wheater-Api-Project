# Weather-Api-Project
This project was a great way to practice fetching data from an external API with asynchronous JavaScript, and further sharpen my HTML/CSS skills.  Its a simple city search, that presents you with weather info!

I used the OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/) free API and i also used a css ready component button from CSS Scan (https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples).
It was fun and in the further future i would definetely try something similar!
